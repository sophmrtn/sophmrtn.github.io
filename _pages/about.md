Hi! I am a PhD Student on the [i4Health](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/intelligent-imaging-healthcare/){:target="_blank"} CDT programme at UCL and member of the [MANIFOLD Lab](https://manifold-lab.netlify.app){:target="_blank"}.

My research focuses on interpretable deep learning methods applied to the early detection of dementia using neuroimaging. These include post-hoc **explanation methods** that visualise relevant features as well as recent advancements in **interpretable neural network** architectures. A review paper summarising the current state of the field is ongoing, and the registered protocol can be found [here](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=291992){:target="_blank"}. You can find this and my (*fingers-crossed*) future publications [here](https://sophmrtn.github.io/publications/).

I am also a Director of [The Blackett Family](https://www.theblackettlabfamily.com){:target="_blank"}, a network for UK based Black physicists, and a Board Trustee for the educational charity, [Project Partners](https://projectpartners.org.uk/){:target="_blank"}. Through these organisations, I am able to share my research with various groups and take part in public engagement opportunities, some of which are listed on the [outreach](https://sophmrtn.github.io/outreach/) page.

Outside of work and other projects, I enjoy reading, keeping active and learning new things. I'm also a self-proclaimed shopaholic and Netflix-binger.

Please feel free to [contact](mailto:s.martin.20@ucl.ac.uk) me for collaboration or questions!
