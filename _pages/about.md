Hi! I am a PhD Student at University College London on the [i4Health](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/intelligent-imaging-healthcare/){:target="_blank"} CDT programme. I'm excited by the application of machine learning in the healthcare industry and passionate about increasing representation in STEM. 

My research project focuses on interpretable deep learning in brain imaging, specifically for the early detection of dementia. I am a member of the [MANIFOLD Lab](https://manifold-lab.netlify.app){:target="_blank"} group and will be investigating deep learning approaches with **neuroimaging** for the diagnosis and prognosis of dementia using a range of datasets. These methods include post-hoc **explanation methods** that aim to visualise relevant features as well as recent advancements in **interpretable neural network** architectures. A review paper summarising the current state of the field is ongoing, and the registered protocol can be found [here](https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=291992){:target="_blank"}.

I am also a Director of [The Blackett Family](https://www.theblackettlabfamily.com){:target="_blank"}, a network for UK based Black physicists, and a Board Trustee for the educational charity, [Project Partners](https://projectpartners.org.uk/){:target="_blank"}. Through these organisations, I am able to share my research with various groups and take part in public engagement opportunities, some of which are listed on the [outreach](https://sophmrtn.github.io/outreach/) page.

Outside of work and other projects, I enjoy reading, keeping active and trying new things. I also like listening to music and have an unhealthy obsession with long coats and ankle boots...

Please feel free to [contact](mailto:s.martin.20@ucl.ac.uk) me for collaboration or questions!
