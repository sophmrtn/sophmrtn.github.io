I am a Research Fellow within the [Hawkes Institute](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/hawkes-institute/){:target="_blank"} at UCL and member of the [MANIFOLD Lab](https://manifold-lab.netlify.app){:target="_blank"}.

My PhD research focused on applying explainable artificial intelligence methods to neuroimaging-based dementia prediction models. This work aimed to explore whether model explanations can be used to bridge the gap between artificial intelligence and healthcare, offer clinically meaningful insights and how best to validate their quality in a context-aware manner. My latest findings are currently being prepared for publication [(preprint here)](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.13.25320382v2){:target="_blank"} and my previous publications are available [here](https://sophmrtn.github.io/publications/).

Outside of my research, I am a Director of [The Blackett Family](https://www.theblackettlabfamily.com){:target="_blank"}, a network for UK based Black physicists, and a Board Trustee for the educational charity, [Project Partners](https://projectpartners.org.uk/){:target="_blank"}. Through these organisations, I've been able to share my academic journey and take part in public engagement opportunities, some of which are listed on the [outreach](https://sophmrtn.github.io/outreach/) page. In my spare time, I like to eat good food, shop, and am a huge advocate for binge-watching as many TV series as possible.

Please feel free to [contact](mailto:sophie.a.martin@ucl.ac.uk) me for collaborations or a chat!
