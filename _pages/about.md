I am a PhD Student on the [i4Health](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/intelligent-imaging-healthcare/){:target="_blank"} CDT at UCL and member of the [MANIFOLD Lab](https://manifold-lab.netlify.app){:target="_blank"}.

My research focuses on applying interpretable deep learning to predict dementia using brain imaging. I am interested in understanding how explanations can be used to bridge the gap between AI and healthcare. Recently, I published a review paper summarising the state-of-the-art in interpretable dementia research which can be found [here](https://alz-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/alz.12948){:target="_blank"}. You can find this and any future publications [here](https://sophmrtn.github.io/publications/).

Outside of my research, I am a Director of [The Blackett Family](https://www.theblackettlabfamily.com){:target="_blank"}, a network for UK based Black physicists, and a Board Trustee for the educational charity, [Project Partners](https://projectpartners.org.uk/){:target="_blank"}. Through these organisations, I'm able to share my research with various groups and take part in public engagement opportunities, some of which are listed on the [outreach](https://sophmrtn.github.io/outreach/) page. In my spare time, I like to exercise, eat lots of good food and am a huge advocate for binge-watching as many TV series as possible.

Please feel free to [contact](mailto:s.martin.20@ucl.ac.uk) me for collaborations or a chat!
