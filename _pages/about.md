Hi! I am a **PhD student** at University College London on the [i4Health](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/intelligent-imaging-healthcare/){:target="_blank"} CDT programme. I'm excited by the application of machine learning in the healthcare industry and passionate about diversity in STEM. My research project focuses on **interpretable deep learning** in brain imaging, specifically for the early detection of dementia.

I am also a Director of a network of UK based Black physicists, [The Blackett Family](https://www.theblackettlabfamily.com){:target="_blank"}, and I am a Board Trustee for the educational charity, [Project Partners](https://projectpartners.org.uk/){:target="_blank"}. 

For more information, please check out my [projects](projects) page.
