I was a teaching assistant on the module [Introduction to Deep Learning](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/introduction-to-deep-learning/COMP0090). This included a guest lecture on _Model Interpretation_ summarising current state-of-the-art approaches to interpretability and explainability in machine learning.
