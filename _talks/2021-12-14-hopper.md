This talk was part of the 15th Annual [London Hopper Colloquium](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/events/2021/dec/london-hopper-colloquium-2021) which is an event aimed at Women in Computer Science organised by UCL and the BCS Academy of Computing. My abstract was chosen to be part of a list of finalists, each giving a short presentation on their research to a general audience.
